# calculator2.0
Second attempt

I'm following this tutorial: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/] 
on how to develop a working calculator with JavaScript.

The CSS in this project is not my own. I downloaded it from the tutorial website.

As I work on the calculator I will be updating my progress here on GitHub so any feedback is appreciated so I can further develop my skills.

Thanks for reading! :)
